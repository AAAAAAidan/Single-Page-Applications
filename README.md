# Single Page Applications

Two simple applications for practice with Vue and React. The two applications were made to be functionally and visually identical in order to find my personal preference to eventually implement into my other projects.

### Technical Overview

* Same page list filtering as you type into a search bar

* Same page file pop-up opening and closing

* Static header and footer content between pages

* Routes, redirects, and page history
